    "### Lab 5: Lists and Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will continue to work with lists and loops, and learn how to apply those concepts to matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function with the signature  `def list1_starts_with_list2(list1, list2)`, which returns `True` iff `list1` is at least as long as `list2`, and the first `len(list2)` elements of `list1` are the same as `list2`. Note: `len(lis)` is the length of the list `lis`, i.e., the number of elements in `lis`.\n",
    "     \n",
    "First write the function without using slicing (\"slicing\" means doing things like `list1[2:5]`), and using a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function with the signature `def match_pattern(list1, list2)` which returns `True` iff the pattern `list2` appears in `list1`. In other words, we return `True` iff there is an `i` such that  $0\\leq \\text{i}\\leq\\text{len(list1)-len(list2)}$ and\n",
    " \n",
    "    list1[i] = list2[0]\n",
    "    list1[i + 1] =list2[1]\n",
    "        .\n",
    "        .\n",
    "        .\n",
    "    list1[i + len(list2) â€“ 1] = list2[-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if `list1` is `[4, 10, 2, 3, 50, 100]` and `list2` is  `[2, 3, 50]`, `match_pattern(list1, list2)` returns `True` since the pattern `[2, 3, 50]` appears in `list1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function with the signature `def repeats(list0)`, which returns `True` iff  `list0` contains at least two adjacent elements with the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use a *list of lists* to store a matrix, with each inner list representing a row. For example, you can store the matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "5 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n",
    "0 & -3 & 5 \\\\\n",
    " \\end{array} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "by storing each row as a list: `M = [[5,  6, 7], [0, -3, 5]]`. For ease of reading, since Python allows for line breaks inside brackets, you can write it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    M = [[5,  6, 7],\n",
    "         [0, -3, 5]]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `M[1]` to access the second row of `M` (i.e., `[0, -3, 4]`), and you can use `M[1][2]` to access the third entry in the second row (i.e., `5`).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Problem 4(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function with the signature `def print_matrix_dim(M)` which accepts a matrix M in the format above, and prints the matrix dimensions. For example, `print_matrix_dim([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6] ])` should print `3x2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Problem 4(b)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the product of a matrix $M$ of dimension $(n, m)$ and a vector $v$ of dimension $(m, 1)$ can be written as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "Mv = \\left( \\begin{matrix} \\left(\\sum_{i = 1}^m M_{1, i}v_i \\right) \\\\ ... \\\\ ... \\\\ \\left(\\sum_{i = 1}^m M_{n, i}v_i \\right) \\end{matrix} \\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function with the signature `def mult_M_v(M, v)` which returns the product $M v$ of a matrix $M$ and a vector $v$. Vectors are stored as lists of `float`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write this function, you will need to create a new vector. Here are two ways to create a new vector (stored as a list) with 10 zeros in it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ten_zeros1 = [0]*10\n",
    "\n",
    "    ten_zeros2 = []\n",
    "    for i in range(10):\n",
    "      ten_zeros2.append(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Problem 4(c) (challenge)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function to perform matrix multiplication."
