    "### Lab 4: Loops and $\\pi$\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, you will practice writing loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a function that computes the sum of a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def sum_nums(L):\n",
    "      s = 0\n",
    "      for num in L:\n",
    "        s += num\n",
    "\n",
    "      return s\n",
    "      \n",
    "Write a function with the signature `def count_evens(L)` that returns the number of even integers in the list `L`. Assume \\verb;L; only contains integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `str()` to convert objects to strings: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> str(42)\n",
    "    ‘42’\n",
    "    \n",
    "In particular, you can obtain the string representation of a list `list0` by using `str()`\n",
    "    >> list0 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    >> str(list0)\n",
    "    ‘[1, 2, 3]’\n",
    "    \n",
    "Without using `str()` with arguments that are lists (using it with arguments that are not lists is fine), write a function with the signature `list_to_str(lis)` which returns the string representation of the list `lis`. You may assume `lis` only contains integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reminder:\n",
    "    >> \"hello\" + \"python\"\n",
    "    \"hellopython\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 3\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compare lists using the `==` operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> l1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    >> l2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "    >> l3 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    >> l1 == l2\n",
    "    False\n",
    "    >> l1 == l3\n",
    "    True\n",
    "\n",
    "Without using the `==` operator to compare lists (you can still compare individual elements of the lists), write a function `lists_are_the_same(list1, list2)` which returns `True` iff `list1` and `list2` contain the same elements in the same order.  You'll need to use a loop (either while or for)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 4: Simplifying Fractions\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function with the signature `simpify_fraction(n, m)` which prints the simplified version of the fraction $\\frac{n}{m}$. For example, `simplify_fraction(3,6)` should print `1/2` and `simplify_fraction(8, 4)` should print `2/1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: use a similar technique to the one we used when determining whether a number is prime. That is, try dividing both the numerator and the denominator by every possible divisor in turn. For example, if you are simplifying `16/12`, you can try dividing both by 16, 15, 14, ...., 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to use a complicated algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (although you certainly can do that, in Problem 4). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 5: Some more $\\pi$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we would like to figure out how many terms in the summation above we need to add up in order to approximate $\\pi$ to \\verb;n; significant digits. Write a function that returns the number of the terms required to obtain an approximation of $\\pi$ using the Leibniz formula that agrees with the actual value of $\\pi$ to $n$ significant digits (i.e., the first $n$ digits are the same in $\\pi$ and in the approximation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The best approximation of $\\pi$ using a \\verb;float; is available in `math.pi` (execute `import math` to be able to use it.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Part of your job is to figure out whether two numbers agree to $n$ significant digits. To figure that out, for a `float x` consider what `int(x*(10**n))` means.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 6: Euclid's Algorithm (challenge)\n",
    "\n",
    "A more efficient way of simplifying fractions than what we suggested for Problem 2 is [Euclid's algorithm](http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Euclid.shtml):\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement and test Euclid's algorithm, and compare the number of steps it takes to the number of steps that the more naive algorithm takes.\n",
