    "\n",
    "The solutions for the calculator lab  are linked from the course webpage. Download those solutions. Create the file `test_calc.py`, and add in some testing code for the calculator lab in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block of `test_calc.py` (remember to `import lab02`). Set up the testing such that in `test_calc.py`, you print `\"Test 1 failed\"` or `\"Test 1 passed\"`, `\"Test 2 failed\"` or `\"Test 2 passed\"`, etc., depending on whether the tests fail or pass. In order to do that, you should define a new function in `lab02.py`, named `get_current_value`. You can then have code along the lines of\n",
